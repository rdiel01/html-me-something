        <p class='intro'>
                Hi! I'm Ryan Diel and I love boardgames. I enjoy all kinds of different games
                and introducing them to people. This is my personal top ten list of boardgames. 

        </p>
        <!--                    My goal is to provide some insight into these games and explaining why I like 
                them so much.           Since there are so many different types of games, I have split 
                this list into two different top ten lists. The first list will be my top 
                introduction games, often refered to as gateway games. These games have a 
                combination of attributes that make them easier to approach and therefore 
                great for introdug people to the joy of hobby boardgaming. My second list 
                consists of heavier games. These games can seem intimidating at first, but
                are still a blast. Please note that this list is my own opinion and I may
                have missed a great game. I made this website for a class and didn't have
                a lot of time to create my lists. I hope you enjoy these games as much as I do!-->

                <h3>T'Zolkin: The Mayan Calendar</h3>
                <h5>Designer: Simone Luciani, Daniele Tascini</h5>
                <p>
                        Tzolkin: The Mayan Calendar presents a new game mechanism: dynamic worker 
                        placement. Players representing different Mayan tribes place their workers 
                        on giant connected gears, and as the gears rotate they take the workers to 
                        different action spots.
                </p>
                <p>
                        This mechanic provides plenty of strategy and chances to cut into other Players
                        plans. There are also several paths to victory allowing for a variety of ways
                        play. This was a very memorable game for me and I look forward to plaing it again!
                </p>

                <h3>Legendary Encounters: Alien Deck Building Game</h3>
                <h5>Designer: Ben Cichoski, Daniel Mandel </h5>
                <p>
                        Legendary Encounters: An Alien Deck Building Game, based on the four movies of 
                        the Alien series, is a fully cooperative game with original art. The Legendary line
                        of games have taken on several popular licenses including Marvel, Buffy the Vampire Slayer
                        and Firefly.<br/>
                        Cooperative games have a tendency to be too easy in my opinion. This game provides a 
                        real challenge. You can have a great start and feel confident, then all of a sudden you find yourself
                        with your back to a wall and no where to go.

                <h3>Mombasa</h3>
                <h5>Designer: Alexander Pfister</h5>
                <p>
                        In Mombasa, players acquire shares of chartered companies based in Mombasa, 
                        Cape Town, Saint-Louis, and Cairo and propagate trading posts of these companies 
                        throughout the African continent in order to earn the most money.<br/>
                        Mombasa features a unique, rotating-display hand-mechanism that drives game play. 
                        Each round players choose action cards from their hand, then reveal them 
                        simultaneously and carry out the actions. These cards are then placed in 
                        a discard pile, and the previously played cards recovered for the subsequent round.</p>

                <h3>Pixel Tactics</h3>
                <h5>Designer: D. Brad Talton, Jr.</h5>
                <p>
                        Pixel Tactics is a head-to-head game of tactical combat for two players. 
                        Each player has an identical deck of 25 cards, from which they draft a leader. 
                        The leader's abilities alter vastly the strategy and playability of every 
                        other card in the deck, making the game playable in 25 different ways.<br/>
                        In the game, players take turns placing cards and attacking. Each card can 
                        activate in various ways, taking on offensive capabilities in the front 
                        rows of the unit, or support powers in the back rows. Cards can also be 
                        played as orders – powerful single-time effects that can turn the tide of battle.
                        Play continues until either player's leader is defeated. A typical game 
                        is best of three or five rounds.

                <h3>Captain S.O.N.A.R.</h3>
                <h5>Designer: Roberto Fraga, Yohan Lemonnier</h5>
                <p>
                        In Captain Sonar, you and your teammates control a state-of-the-art submarine trying 
                        to locate the enemy team's submarine in order to blow it out of the water before 
                        they can do the same to you. Each player takes a role in this merciless confrontation. 
                        Be organized and communicate because a captain is nothing without his crew: 
                        the Chief Mate, the Radio Operator, and the Engineer.<br/>
                        Captain S.O.N.A.R. is a great unique experience. Gameplay is simultaneous,so teams do
                        not take turns. Once the game starts the Captain begins giving orders and each crew member 
                        is responsible for their role's tasks. This is a great cooperative experience and teamwork
                        is extremely important.

                <h3>Terra Mystica</h3>
                <h5>Designer: Jens Drögemüller, Helge Ostertag</h5>
                <p>
                        In the land of Terra Mystica dwell 14 different peoples in seven landscapes, and each 
                        group is bound to its own home environment, so to develop and grow, they must terraform 
                        neighboring landscapes into their home environments in competition with the other groups.<br/>
                        Terra Mystica is a game with very little luck that rewards strategic planning. Each player 
                        governs one of the 14 groups. With subtlety and craft, the player must attempt to rule as 
                        great an area as possible and to develop that group's skills. There are also four 
                        religious cults in which you can progress. To do all that, each group has special skills and abilities.

                <h3>Food Chain Magnate</h3>
                <h5>Designer: Jeroen Doumen, Joris Wiersinga</h5>
                <p>
                        Food Chain Magnate is a heavy strategy game about building a fast food chain. The focus 
                        is on building your company using a card-driven (human) resource management system. 
                        Players compete on a variable city map through purchasing, marketing and sales, 
                        and on a job market for key staff members.<br/>
                        This game is not for the faint of heart. An average game clocks in around 2 - 4 hours.
                        That is a long time, but this game delivers. The gameplay is well developed and the rule set
                        is concise. If you like really deep strategy and food, this game may be just for you.

                <h3>Agricola</h3>
                <h5>Designer: Uwe Rosenberg</h5>
                <p>
                        In Agricola, you're a farmer in a wooden shack with your spouse and little else. On a turn, 
                        you get to take only two actions, one for you and one for the spouse, from all the possibilities 
                        you'll find on a farm: collecting clay, wood, or stone; building fences; and so on. You might 
                        think about having kids in order to get more work accomplished, but first you need to expand your 
                        house. And what are you going to feed all the little rugrats?<br/>
                        Being a farmer in the 17th century was not easy and Agricola demonstrates that well. The strategy 
                        and planning in this game are very high and you often have to change plans if another player takes
                        the action you were planning on. Agricola can be unforgiving, but I always come back!

                <h3>Race for the Galaxy</h3>
                <h5>Designer: Thomas Lehmann</h5>
                <p>
                        In the card game Race for the Galaxy, players build galactic civilizations by 
                        playing game cards in front of them that represent worlds or technical 
                        and social developments. Some worlds allow players to produce goods, 
                        which can be consumed later to gain either card draws or victory points 
                        when the appropriate technologies are available to them. These are mainly 
                        provided by the developments and worlds that are not able to produce, but 
                        the fancier production worlds also give these bonuses.

                <h3>Magic: The Gathering</h3>
                <h5>Designer: Richard Garfield</h5>
                <p>
                                In the Magic game, you play the role of a planeswalker—a powerful 
                                wizard who fights other planeswalkers for glory, knowledge, and 
                                conquest. Your deck of cards represents all the weapons in your 
                                arsenal. It contains the spells you know and the creatures you can 
                                summon to fight for you.<br/>
                                This is the grandfather of the collectible card game (or CCG) genre. 
                                Players build a deck of cards and duel against an opponent's deck. 
                                Players are wizards attempting to reduce their opponent's life total 
                                to zero by summoning creatures and casting powerful spells. The
                                first player to reduce his opponent's life to zero (or 
                                meet another set win condition) wins the game.
