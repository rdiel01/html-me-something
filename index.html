    <h1>Ryan Diel's top 10 Boardgames</h1>
    <h4>
        Hi! I'm Ryan Diel and I love boardgames. I enjoy all kinds of different games
        and enjoy introducing them to people. There are so many different types of
        games that it can be very overwhelming to know where to start. This is my 
        personal top ten list of boardgames. My goal is to help you find a game you 
        may like by provide some insight into these games and explaining why I like 
        them so much. Since there are so many different types of games, I have split 
        this list into two different top ten lists. The first list will be my top 
        introduction games, often refered to as gateway games. These games have a 
        combination of attributes that make them easier to approach and therefore 
        great for introducing people to the joy of hobby boardgaming. My second list 
        consists of heavier games. These games can seem intimidating at first, but
        are still a blast. Please note that this list is my own opinion and I may
        have missed a great game. I made this website for a class and didn't have
        a lot of time to create my lists. I hope you enjoy these games as much as I do!
